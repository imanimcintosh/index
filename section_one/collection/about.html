    Capturing energy...<br>
    A moment in time where individuals <br>
    came to one place. How are they connected? <br>
    Do our energies draw closer for a particular reason?<br>
    Connecting to the idea of standardization in terms of groups,<br> 
    there is this idea of creating one person or a group made up of<br>  basically the same person,
    but thats just not possible because of <br>our  various differences.
    To illustrate this the mash up of<br> faces layered on
    top of each other creates a blur <br>of one face where nothing is really defined<br> or
    able to be distinguished, <br>in a sense "faceless".<br>
