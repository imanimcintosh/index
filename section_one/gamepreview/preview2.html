                <p>The screen is a surface, one that is so visible yet so discreet.
                It masters the art of camoflauge making it easy for us to move 
                along our virtual lives.<br><br>

                But, do you really know your screen? What does it mean to be psycially intimate with a virtual space? What does sliding your finger
                across this plane feel like ? Why do your fingers move the way they 
                do when interacting with the screen?<br><br>

                These exercises will explore some of the ways we interact with our phones, from within the screen and beyond.
                As you move along the excerises, I encourage you to think about and 
                be aware of the physicality of the screen, the phone and your sense of movement.
