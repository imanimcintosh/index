               <p>The screen is a surface, one that is so visible yet so discreet.
                    It masters the art of camoflauge making it easy for us to move 
                    along our virtual lives.<br><br>

                    But, do you really know your screen? What does sliding your finger
                     across this plane feel like ? Why do your fingers move the way they 
                     do when interacting with the screen?<br><br>

                     As you move along the excerises, I encourage you to think about and 
                     be aware of the physicality of the screen and your sense of movement.
